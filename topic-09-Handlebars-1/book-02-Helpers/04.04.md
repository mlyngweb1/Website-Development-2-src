# if Helper

The **if** helper is similar to an if statement. If the condition evaluates to a truthy value, Handlebars will render the block. 
We can also specify a template section known as `else section`, by using {{else}}. 

To show how the `if` helper works, let us consider the template below:
~~~
{{#if countries}}
  The countries are present.
{{else}}
  The countries are not present.
{{/if}}
~~~

If we provide the following context variable (data):

~~~
var data = {
  "countries": []
}
~~~

We will obtain the result as in the following <a href ="archives/examples/example2.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
