# Helpers

Even though Handlebars is a logic-less templating engine, it can execute simple logics using helpers. A Handlebars *helper* is a simple identifier that may be 
followed by parameters (separated by a space), as shown below:

~~~
{{#helperName parameter1 parameter2 ...}}
  Content here
{{/helperName}}
~~~

Each parameter is a Handlebars expression. These helpers can be accessed from any context in a template.

The terms `block`, `helper`, and `block helper` are sometimes used interchangeably as most of the built-in helpers are blocks. 

Some built-in helpers are **if**, **each**, **unless**, and **with**.
