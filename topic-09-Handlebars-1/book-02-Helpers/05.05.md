# unless and with Helpers

## unless Helper

The **unless** helper is the inverse of the `if` helper. It renders the block when the condition evaluates to a falsy value as can
be seen in the following <a href ="archives/examples/example3.html" target="_blank">example</a>.


## with Helper

In case there is an object with nested properties, and there are a lot of them, it is possible to use **with** to pass the context.

To show how the `with` helper works, let us consider the template below:
~~~
<div>
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>

  {{#with author}}
  <h2>By {{firstName}} {{lastName}}</h2>
  {{/with}}
</div>
~~~

If we provide the following context variable:

~~~
var context = {
  title: "My first post!",
  author: {
    firstName: "Charles",
    lastName: "Jolley"
  }
}
~~~

We will obtain the result as in the following <a href ="archives/examples/example4.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
