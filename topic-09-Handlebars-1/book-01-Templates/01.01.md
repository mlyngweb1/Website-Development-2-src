# Templates

Templates can be written both in the HTML file or separately. In the first case, they appear inside the `<script>` tag with 
a `type="text/x-handlebars-template"` attribute and an `ID`. The variables are written in double curly braces `{{}}` and are known as **expressions**. 

Here is an example:

~~~
<script id="handlebars-demo" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
   <div>
      My name is {{name}}. I am a {{occupation}}.
   </div>
</script>
~~~

With this markup in place, we can see what we have to do use it. In your JavaScript file we firstly need to retrieve the template from the HTML document. 
In the following example, we will use the `ID` of the template for this purpose. After the template has been retrieved, we can compile it by using the 
**Handlebars.compile()** method which returns a function. This function is then executed by passing the context (JSON object) as an argument. 
When the execution is complete, the function returns the desired HTML with all the variables replaced by their corresponding values. 
At this point we can inject the HTML into our web page.

Turning this description into code results in the following snippet:

~~~
// Retrieve the template data from the HTML (jQuery is used here).
var template = $('#handlebars-demo').html();

// Compile the template data into a function
var templateScript = Handlebars.compile(template);

var context = { "name" : "Ritesh Kumar", "occupation" : "developer" };

// html = 'My name is Ritesh Kumar. I am a developer.'
var html = templateScript(context);

// Insert the HTML code into the page
$(document.body).append(html);
~~~
