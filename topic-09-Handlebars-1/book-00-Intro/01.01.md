# What is Handlebars?

Nowadays the majority of the Web consists of dynamic applications in which the data keeps changing frequently. As a result, there is a continuous need to 
update the data rendered on the browser. This is where JavaScript templating engines come to the rescue and become so useful. They simplify the process of 
manually updating the view and at the same time they improve the structure of the application by allowing developers to separate the business logic from 
the rest of the code.

Some of the most well-known JavaScript templating engines are **Mustache**, **Underscore**, **EJS**, and **Handlebars**. 

##Handlebars.js
**Handlebars.** is a client-side (though it can be used on the server, too) templating engine for JavaScript. It is a JavaScript library that you
include in your page just as you include any other JavaScript file. And with it, you can add templates to your HTML page that will be parsed and 
interpolated (values of properties inserted in place) with the values from the data you passed to the Handlebars.js function.
