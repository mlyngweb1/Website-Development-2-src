# What is Handlebars?

Web apps are using JavaScript to create dynamic interfaces now more than ever before, and that is not a trend that will change any time soon. 
DOM manipulation is great for simpler JavaScript apps, but what do you do when you are changing huge chunks of the document with each change of the view? 
That is where JavaScript templating comes into play.

Some of the most well-known JavaScript templating engines are **Mustache**, **Underscore**, **EJS**, and **Handlebars**. 

##Handlebars.js
**Handlebars.** is a client-side (though it can be used on the server, too) templating engine for JavaScript. It is a JavaScript library that you
include in your page just as you include any other JavaScript file. And with it, you can add templates to your HTML page that will be parsed and 
interpolated (values of properties inserted in place) with the values from the data you passed to the Handlebars.js function.
