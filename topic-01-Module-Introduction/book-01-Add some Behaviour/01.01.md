# Adding JavaScript to the code

In Lab01 we have a folder called **.js** and in it is a file called **form.js**. We are going to add code to this file.

In the file **form.html** add a link to the **form.js** file as follows  (after the links to the other **.js** files):

~~~
<script src="js/form.js"></script>
