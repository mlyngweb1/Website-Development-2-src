# Submitting the Form

We now want to add code to respond to the user when the user submits the selection.

Before the membership is processed a few checks must be carried out:

1. Has the user made a selection?
2. Has the user agreed to the terms and conditions?

Once these are checked the final price can be calculated.

~~~
function checkTerms(event) {                                   // Declare function
  var selection = elSelectPackage.options[elSelectPackage.selectedIndex].value; // Get selected option
  if (selection == "none") {                                   // if no selection is made
	  alert("You must make a selection");                  // Display dialog box with error message
	  event.preventDefault();                              // Don't submit form
      return;                                                  // Exit the function
  }


  if (!elTerms.checked) {                                // If terms and conditions checkbox ticked
    elTermsHint.innerHTML = 'You must agree to the terms.'; // Show message
    event.preventDefault();                              // Don't submit form
    return;                                              // Exit the function
  }
  if (elcoupon.checked) {                                // If coupon checkbox ticked 
    price = price * .90;                                 // Apply discount of 10%.
  }
  alert("The membership is \u20AC" + price);             // Display membership charge
}

This function will not run until it is called, so we will add code that reponds to the event of the user submitting the membership form (clicking the submit button) as follows:

~~~
elForm.addEventListener('submit', checkTerms, false);//event listener for submit button - calls checkTerms() function
