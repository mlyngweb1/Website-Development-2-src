# Example One

Here is an example of using a partial:

~~~
<script id="person-partial" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
      <div>
         Phone: {{phone}}<br>
        <a href="mailto:{{email}}">{{email}}</a><br>
        User since {{member_since}}
      </div>
</script>
~~~

We register the partial as follows:

~~~
  Handlebars.registerPartial("person", $("#person-partial").html());
~~~


Let us consider the template below (note the person partial being invoked):

~~~
{{#each people}}
   <h2>{{first_name}} {{last_name}}</h2>
   {{> person}}
{{/each}}
~~~

If we provide the following context variable:

~~~
var data = {
    people: [
        { first_name: "Alan", last_name: "Johnson", phone: "1234567890", email: "alan@test.com", member_since: "Mar 25, 2011" },
        { first_name: "Allison", last_name: "House", phone: "0987654321", email: "allison@test.com", member_since: "Jan 13, 2011" },
        { first_name: "Nick", last_name: "Pettit", phone: "9836592272", email: "nick@test.com", member_since: "Apr 9, 2009" },
        { first_name: "Jim", last_name: "Hoskins", phone: "7284927150", email: "jim@test.com", member_since: "May 21, 2010" },
        { first_name: "Ryan", last_name: "Carson", phone: "8263729224", email: "ryan@test.com", member_since: "Nov 1, 2008" }
    ]
};
~~~

We will obtain the result as in the following <a href ="archives/examples/example1.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
