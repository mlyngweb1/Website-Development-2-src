# What is a Partial

Partials come in handy when you have a chunk of a Handlebars.js template that you need to use in a few different contexts. 
The **Handlebars.registerPartial** method registers a partial. It takes the *name* of the partial as its first argument and either a *template source string* or 
a *compiled template* as its second argument. 

To use a partial from a template, simply include **{{> partialName}}**.
