# What are Custom Helpers?

Handlebars gives you the ability to create your own custom helper. Simply register your function into Handlebars, and any template you compile afterwards can 
access your helper. With custom helpers, we can add any kind or JavaScript logic. Custom helpers are created in the JavaScript code, not inside the Handlebars template.

Custom block helpers are also registered with the **Handlebars.registerHelper** method.
