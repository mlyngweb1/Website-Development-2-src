# What are Custom Helpers?

As we have seen, Handlebars has some built in helpers such as #each, #if, etc... Handlebars also gives you the ability to create your own custom helper. 
This means writing code to do something that you want (like converting names to sentence case).
Simply register your function into Handlebars, and any template you compile afterwards can 
access your helper. With custom helpers, we can add any kind or JavaScript logic. Custom helpers are created in the JavaScript code, not inside the Handlebars template.

Custom block helpers are also registered with the **Handlebars.registerHelper** method.
