# Syntaxes

## Expressions


We already saw expressions in the previous example. The variables used inside the templates are surrounded by double curly braces `{{}}` and are known as 
**expressions**:

~~~
My name is {{name}}
~~~

## HTML Escaping
Handlebars can escape the value returned by the expression. For example the character < is converted into &lt. If you do not want Handlebars to 
escape a value, you have to surround the variable using triple curly braces `{{{variableName}}}`. For example, when the following template:

~~~
I am learning {{language}}. It is {{{adjective}}}.
~~~

is used with the context variable reported below:

~~~
var context = {
  "language" : "<h3>Handlebars</h3>",
  "adjective": "<h3>awesome</h3>"
}
~~~

the resulting HTML can be found in this <a href ="archives/examples/example2.html" target="_blank">example</a>.
