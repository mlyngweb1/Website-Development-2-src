# Exercise

In this exercise we will explore DOM Manipulation and Event Handling.

- Create a folder called Week04.
- Download, extract and open the [Lab01](archives/Lab01.zip) folder in Week03.
- Open the lab01 folder. Here you will find a web page (**calulator.html**) as follows:

We will now add JavaScript code to the (**calculator.js**) file to add behaviour (interactivity) to the web page.

We need to add code that will respond to the following events:

- The user leaving (**blur**) either of the text input boxes (number 1 and number 2).
- The user changing (**change**) either of the text input boxes values.
- The user clicking (**submit**) the Add button.

## blur or change event

This will require code that will check that the value in each text box is:

- A Number.
- Ranges between 1 and 100.
- Not empty.

If any of the above errors occur then a error message is written to a div (**feedback**), and focus returns to the text input box causing the error.

## submit event

This will require code that will:

- Obtain the value inside each text input box.
- Add these values together.
- Place the result of the addition in the text box (**total**).

## To do

Can you add some code to perform subtraction?
