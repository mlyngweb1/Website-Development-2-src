# Text Box

## Returning the value of a text box

To get the value from a specific text box, you need to know it's **id** in order to use **document.getElementById()**. You also need the **value** attribute as this 
returns the value in the text box.

HTML
~~~
<input type="text" name="days" id="days" value="0"  required pattern = "[0-9]{1}">
~~~

JavaScript
~~~
numdays=document.getElementById("days").value;
~~~

## Setting the value of a text box

To put a value into a text box, again you need to know it's id. To put the value of 2 into the text box (days):

JavaScript
~~~
document.getElementById("days").value=2;
~~~

The following <a href="archives/Class Files/WIT Ski Club.htm" target = "_blank">example</a>, obtains the value from 2 text boxes and displays a message.
