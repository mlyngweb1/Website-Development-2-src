# Nodes

## The document node

Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own **DOM node**. At the top of the tree a **document node** is added; it represents the
entire page. 

When you access any element, attribute, or text node, you navigate to it via the document node. It is the starting point for all visits to the DOM tree.

## Element nodes

HTML elements describe the structure of an HTML page (The `<h1> - <h6>` elements describe what parts are headings; the `<p>` tags indicate where paragraphs of text start and finish, and so on).

To access the **DOM** tree, you start by looking for elements. Once you find the element you want, then you can access its text and attribute nodes (if you want to).

##Attribute nodes

The opening tags of HTML elements can carry attributes and these are represented by attribute nodes in the DOM tree.

Attributes nodes are not *children* of the element that carries them; they are *part* of that element.

##Text nodes

Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within that element. This is stored in its own text node.
