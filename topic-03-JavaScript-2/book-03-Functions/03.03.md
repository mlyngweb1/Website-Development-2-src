# Returning Values

Variables declared inside a function are local to that function (unless they are global). You cannot (usually) get their value outside 
the function unless you return the value from the function.

~~~
function total(a, b, c)
{
   var result = a + b + c;
   return result;
}
~~~

**result** is a local variable to the function called total. We cannot see the value of *total* outside of the function
unless we return it.

We could call the function and see the returned value as in the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example3.html" target = "_blank">example</a>:
~~~
calculateresult = total(5, 6, 7);
document.write("<h3>The sum of 5, 6, and 7 is " + calculateresult + "</h3>");
~~~

Or, we could see the returned value as follows:
~~~
document.write("<h3>The sum of 5, 6, and 7 is " + total(5, 6, 7));
~~~
