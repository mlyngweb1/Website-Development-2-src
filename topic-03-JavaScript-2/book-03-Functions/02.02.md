# Parameter Passing

When a function receives a value as a parameter, that value is given a name and can be accessed, using that name, by the function. 
The names of parameters are taken from the function definition and are applied in the order in which parameters are passed in.

~~~
function about_you(name, age, shoesize)
{
   document.write("<h1>All About You</h1>");
   document.write("<p/><strong>Your Name is:</strong> " + name);
   document.write("<p/><strong>Your Age is:</strong> " + age);
   document.write("<p/><strong>Your shoe size is:</strong> "+ shoesize);
}
~~~

The above function has 3 parameters and utilises the values passed in inside the function.

To call the function , we could do so as in the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example2.html" target = "_blank">example</a>:
~~~
<body onload="about_you('Chris', 28, 10)">
