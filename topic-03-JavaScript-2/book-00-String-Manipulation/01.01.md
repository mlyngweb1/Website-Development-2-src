# length

This property returns the number of characters in a given string. Note that this is not a method and so you do not have to 
place brackets when using it.

*var namelen = myname.length*

<script>
 document.write("<h1>length</h1>");
 var you = prompt("Enter your name", "");
 document.write("The length of your name("+you+") is " + you.length);
