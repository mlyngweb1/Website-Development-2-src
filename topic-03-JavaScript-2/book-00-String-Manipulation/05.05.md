# substring()

Syntax: **substring(index1[, index2])**

The **substring()** method returns a portion of a string which starts at index1 and continues up to, but does not include, 
the character at index2. 

The following rules apply:

- If index1 is less than 0, it will be treated as 0.
- If index2 is greater than the length of the string, it is treated as the length of the string.
- If the two index values are equal, an empty string is returned.
- If index2 is missing, all characters up to the end of the string are taken.
- If either argument is less than 0 or is NaN, it is treated as if it were 0.
- If either argument is greater than the length of the string, either argument will use length of the string.
- If index1 > index2, then substring will swap those 2 arguments.
