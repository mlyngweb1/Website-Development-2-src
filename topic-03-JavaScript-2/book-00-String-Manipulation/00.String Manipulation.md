This lab will introduce you to the String Manipulation methods.

Broadly speaking, string manipulation involves joining strings together, splitting them apart or searching through them. 
JavaScript has methods (functions) which perform all of those operations and much more. 

**Note**: Strings are arrays of characters where the first character starts at position 0 (zero).
