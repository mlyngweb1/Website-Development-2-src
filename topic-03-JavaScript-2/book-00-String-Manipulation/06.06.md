# slice()

Syntax: **slice(start,end)**

The **slice()** method works like the substring function. It returns a portion of a string. 
It requires a start number that indicates the starting index position for the extracted string. 
You can specify an optional end number if you wish. This specifies where to end the extraction (end value is not included). 

The following rules apply:

- If end is omitted, slice extracts chars to the end of the string, exactly like substring().
- If start > end, slice() will NOT swap the 2 arguments.
- If start is negative, it is treated as length + start where length is the length of the string.
- If end is negative, it is treated as length + end.

 var you = "Kilkenny";
 start=0;
 finish=2;
 var subset = you.slice(start,finish);
 document.write("Starting Value: "+start);
 document.write("<br>Finishing Value: "+finish);
 document.write("<br>The characters from position " +start+ " to "+ finish +" (but not including "+finish+") are: " + subset);

 start=3;
 var subset = you.slice(start);
 document.write("<br><br>Starting Value: "+start);
 document.write("<br>The characters from position " +start+ " to the end of the string are: " + subset);
