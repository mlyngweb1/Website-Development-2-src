# indexOf()

Syntax: **indexOf("search"[, offset])**

The **indexOf()** method is used to search a string for a search string. *If the **characters(search string)** are found, 
then the index of the first character is returned. If the search is unsuccessful then -1 is returned*. 

**Note**:The search begins at position 0 unless a value is specified for the offset.

## lastIndexOf("search"[, offset])

This function does exactly the same thing as **indexOf()** but works its way backwards along the string. 
The offset works in exactly the same way as in indexOf(), but the default value is **string.length - 1**.
