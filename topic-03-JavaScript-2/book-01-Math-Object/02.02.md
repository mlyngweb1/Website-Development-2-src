# Generating Random Numbers

**Math.random()** returns a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1. The random number generator is seeded from the current time.The function always delivers a 16-place decimal that ranges from 0.0000000000000000 to 0.9999999999999999. 
If you want to get a random number between 1 and another number, just multiply the random() method by the uppermost number and add 1 to the total. 

For Example: to generate a random number from 1 to 10:

~~~
var bigDecimal = Math.random();
var improvedNum = (bigDecimal * 10) + 1;
var mynumber = Math.floor(improvedNum);
~~~

This is what happens in the code above, line by line:

- Line 1: Generates a 16-place decimal and assigns it to the variable bigDecimal.
- Line 2: Converts the 16-place decimal to a number ranging from 0.0000000000000000 through 9.9999999999999999, then adds 1, so the range winds up 1.0000000000000000 through 10.9999999999999999. This number is assigned to the variable improvedNum.
- Line 3: Rounds down the value represented by improvedNum down to the nearest integer that ranges from 1 through 10 and assigns it to mynumber.

A shorthand way of writing the above is:
~~~
var mynumber =Math.floor(Math.random()* 10 + 1);
~~~

If you want to get a random number between 2 numbers where the first number is not 1 then use the following calculation:
~~~
var mynumber =Math.floor(Math.random()*(max - min + 1) + min); 
~~~
