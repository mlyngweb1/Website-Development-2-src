# Using the Date object

<dl>
<dt>**Date()**</dt>
<dd>Constructs an empty date object. 
<br>
For example: <a href ="archives/Class Files/d1.html" target = "_blank">var d = new Date();</a></dd>

<dt>**Date(milliseconds)**</dt>
<dd>Constructs a new Date object based on the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 hours on 01/01/1970. 
<br>
For example: <a href ="archives/Class Files/d2.html" target = "_blank">var d = new Date(9999999999);</a></dd>

<dt>**Date(string)**</dt>
<dd>	Creates a Date object based upon the contents of a text string. 
The string must be in the format which is created by the Date.parse() function.
<br>
For example: <a href ="archives/Class Files/d3.html" target = "_blank">var d = new Date("January 1, 2018 00:00:01");</a></dd>

<dt>**Date(year, month, day[, hour, minute, second])**</dt>
<dd>Creates a new Date object based upon the numerical values for the year, month and day. 
Optional time values may be supplied. January is represented by 0, and December by 11.
<br>
For example: <a href ="archives/Class Files/d4.html" target = "_blank">var d = new Date(2017,11,25,11,33,30,0);</a></dd>
</dl>
