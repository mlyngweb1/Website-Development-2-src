# Accessing Arrays

You can refer to a particular element in an array by referring to the name of the array and the index number. 
The index number starts at 0.

For example,the following line of code (**document.write(myArray[0])**) will result in the following output:*Baseball*.

The following code excerpt shows an Array declaration of 7 elements (days). A for loop is then used traverse through 
each element starting at the first element([0]) and stopping at the last element(data.length -1]). 

~~~
<script>
  document.write("<h1>Looping through an Array</h1>");
  var data = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"];
  var len = data.length;
  for (count=0; count<len; count++)
  {
    document.write(data[count] +  "<br>");
  }
</script>
~~~
<a href="archives/Class Files/example1.html" target = "_blank">Example</a>. 
 

**Note**: You can also output an array as follows:**document.write(data);** where data is the name of the array as in the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example3.html" target = "_blank">example</a>. 

##  For...In Statement

The for...in statement loops through the elements of an array or through the properties of an object.

Syntax:

~~~
for (variable in object)
  {
  code to be executed
  }
~~~

<a href="archives/Class Files/example2.html" target = "_blank">Example</a>. 


~~~
<script>
  document.write("<h1>Looping through an Array</h1>");
  var data = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"];
  for (x in data)
  {
    document.write(data[x] +  "<br>");
  }
</script>

##Modify Values in Existing Arrays

To modify a value in an existing array, just add a new value to the array with a specified index number:**myArray[0]="Hurling";**. 

Now, the following code: **document.write(myArray[0]);** will result in the following output:*Hurling*.
