# Creating a JavaScript Array

Creating an array is slightly different than creating a normal variable. Because JavaScript has variables and properties 
associated with arrays, you have to use a special function to create a new array. 

You can create an array using 3 methods:

## Method One

~~~
<script>
  var myArray=[];
  myArray[0] = "Baseball";
  myArray[1] = "Cricket";
  myArray[2] = "Football";
</script>
~~~

## Method Two

~~~
<script>;
  var myArray = ["Baseball", "Cricket", "Football"];
</script>
~~~

## Method Three

~~~
<script>;
  var myArray = new Array();
  myArray[0] = "Baseball";
  myArray[1] = "Cricket";
  myArray[2] = "Football";
</script>
~~~
