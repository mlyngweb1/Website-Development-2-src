# Reading, Setting and Removing HTML attributes

jQuery includes general purpose functions for handling HTML attributes such as the attr() and removeAttr() functions.

### attr()

The attr() method can be used to either fetch the value of an attribute from the first element in the matched set or set attribute values onto all matched elements. For example, to determine the current graphic file a particular `<img>` points to, you pass the string 'src' to the function:

```js
var imagefile = $('#banner img').attr('src');
```

The attr() function returns the attribute's value as it is set in the HTML. This code returns the src property for the first `<img>` tag inside another tag with the ID of banner.

If you pass a second argument to the attr() function, you can set the tag's attribute. For example, to swap in a different image, you can change an `<img>` tag's src property like this:

```js
$('#banner img').attr('src', 'images/newImage.jpg');
```

In this <a href="archives/examples/changelandscape.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a>, the image is changed when the user clicks the button.

### removeAttr()

If you want to completely remove an attribute from a tag, use the removeAttr() function. For example, this code removes the bgColor property from the <body> tag:

```js
$('body').removeAttr('bgColor');
```

To read or set the value of a text box, we use the val() function. If we have a text box with an id = firstname, then to read the value of this text box we would use `$('#firstname').val()` and to set a value, use `$('#firstname').val(new Value)`, where new Value is not empty. Both are used in the following <a href="archives/examples/form2.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a>.
