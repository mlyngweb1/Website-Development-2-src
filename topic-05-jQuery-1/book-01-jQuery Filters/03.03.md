# Chaining Functions

Sometimes you will want to perform several operations on a selection of elements. For example, say you want to set the width and height of a `<div>` tag (with an ID of popup) using JavaScript. jQuery lets you do this as follows:

```js
$('#popup').width(300).height(300);
```

jQuery uses a unique principle called chaining, which lets you add functions one after the other. Each function is connected to the next by a period(.), and operates on the same jQuery collection of elements as the previous function. So the code above changes the width of the element with the ID popup, and changes the height of the element. Chaining jQuery functions lets you concisely carry out a large number of actions. For example, say you not only want to set the width and height of the `<div>` tag but also want to add text inside the `<div>` and make it fade into view (assuming it is not visible at present). You can do that very succinctly as follows:

```js
$('#popup').width(300).height(100).text("This is an example of Chaining").fadeIn(1000);
```

In this <a href="archives/examples/chaining.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a>, the code applies four jQuery functions (width(), height(), text(), and fadeIn()) to the tag with an ID name of popup.
