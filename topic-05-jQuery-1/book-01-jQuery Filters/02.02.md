# Automatic Loops

If jQuery returns a set of elements, you would think you need a loop to process each element in turn, but because looping through a collection of elements is so common, jQuery functions have that feature built right in. In other words, when you apply a jQuery function to a selection of elements, you do not need to create a loop yourself, since the function does it automatically.
For example, to select all images inside a `<div>` tag with an ID of slideshow and then hide those images, you write this in jQuery:

```js
$('#slideshow img').hide();
```

The list of elements created with `$('#slideshow img')` might include 50 images. The hide() function automatically loops through the list, hiding each image individually.

In the following <a href="archives/examples/loopexample.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a> we hide all paragraphs (`<p>`) using: `$('p').fadeOut(1500);` And we have also included the option to select and display/show all paragraphs: `$('p').fadeIn(1500);`

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('button#btn1').on('click', function(){
      $('p').fadeOut(1500);
  });

  $('button#btn2').on('click', function(){
      $('p').fadeIn(2500);
  });

});
```

We could have used hide and show but the fadeIn and fadeOut can be slowed down by providing a numeric value between the brackets.
