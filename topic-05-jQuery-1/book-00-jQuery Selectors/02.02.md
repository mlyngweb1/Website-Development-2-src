# Getting Started with jQuery

jQuery is a library of JavaScript Functions. jQuery is a lightweight "write less, do more" JavaScript library.

The first step in using jQuery is downloading it - the <code>jquery.js</code> file is a single JavaScript file that you can link to a Web page to use. Compressed and uncompressed copies of jQuery files are available. The uncompressed file is best used during development or debugging; the compressed file saves bandwidth and improves performance in production. If you don't want to store the jQuery library on your own computer, you can use the hosted jQuery library from Google or Microsoft.

```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js">
</script>
```

We will put the file in a subfolder called <code>js</code>. To use the file, you must attach it to your Web page. It is just an external .js file, so you attach it just like any external JavaScript file. We will use the compressed version <code>(jquery-3.1.1.min.js)</code>.

```html
<script src="js/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
```

Once you have attached the jQuery file, you are ready to add your own scripts that take advantage of jQuery's advanced functions. For example, you can attach another external JavaScript file with your own programming in it, or add a second `<script>` tag to the Web page and start programming:

```html
<script src="js/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/example.js"></script>
```
