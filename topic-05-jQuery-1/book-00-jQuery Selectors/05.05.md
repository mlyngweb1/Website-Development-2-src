# The Document Ready Function

You might have noticed that all jQuery functions, in our examples, are inside a `document.ready()` function. As almost everything we do when using jQuery reads or manipulates the document object model (DOM), we need to make sure that we start adding events etc. as soon as the DOM is ready. If you want an event to work on your page, you should call it inside the `$(document).ready()` function. Everything inside it will load as soon as the DOM is loaded and before the page contents are loaded.

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('a[href^="http://"]').css({
   'font-weight':'bold',
   'font-style':'italic',
   'color':'black'
  });
});
```
