# jQuery Attribute Selectors

Attribute selectors let you select elements based on whether the element has a particular attribute, and even check to make sure the attribute matches a specific value. For example, you could find every link tag that points outside your site, and add code to just those links.

## Examples:

- `$('img[alt]')` select all `<img>` tags with the alt attribute set.
- `$('input[type="text"]')` select all text boxes in a form.
- `$('a[href^="http://"]')` select all links that point outside your site.
- `$('a[href^="mailto:"]')` select all mailto: links.
- `$('a[href$=".pdf"]')` select all links that point to PDF files.
- `$('a[href*="wit.ie"]')` select all links that point to `wit.ie`.

In the following <a href="archives/examples/attributetest.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a>, we see 2 of the 3 links have changed (font: bold and italic; color: black) because the links with the `href^="http://"` attribute are selected and modified.

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('a[href^="http://"]').css({
   'font-weight':'bold',
   'font-style':'italic',
   'color':'black'
  });
});
```

If we want to change more than one CSS property on an element, we can pass an object literal to the `.css()` function. Think of an object literal as a list of property name/value pairs. After each property name, you insert a colon (:) followed by a value; each name/value pair is separated by a comma, and the whole lot is surrounded by braces {}.

```js
{
   'font-weight':'bold',
   'font-style':'italic',
   'color':'black'
}
```
