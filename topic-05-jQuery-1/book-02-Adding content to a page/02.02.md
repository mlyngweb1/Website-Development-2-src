# Replacing and Removing Selections

At times you may want to completely replace or remove a selected element. For example, say you have created a pop-up dialog box using JavaScript that is an absolutely positioned `<div>` floating on top of the page. When the visitor clicks the "Close" button on the dialog box, you naturally want to remove the dialog from the page. To do so, you can use the jQuery remove() function. If the pop-up dialog box has an ID of popup; you can use the following code to delete it:

```js
$('popup').remove();
```
