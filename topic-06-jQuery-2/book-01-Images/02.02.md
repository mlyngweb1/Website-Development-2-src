# Image Replacement (with Effects)

Because the images are included in links in the previous examples, if you clicked an image then you would follow the link and a new page would open displaying a bigger image of the link/image clicked. Open the <a href="archives/examples/rollover.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a> to check this out.

We will now look at another <a href="archives/examples/animate.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a> that will ignore the click event on the thumbnail image (and associated link) and instead get the link's href value and display it on the current page (i.e. replace the larger image with the href value of the chosen link). As the image is being replaced, it fades into view slowly as opposed to immediately.

This script uses the link's click event inside the gallery `<div>`, `$('#gallery a').click(function()`, to achieve the following steps:

- **Stop the default behaviour of the link:** Normally, clicking a link takes you to another page. We will add some code to prevent the browser from following that link
```js
evt.preventDefault();
```

- **Get the href value of the link (imgPath):** The link actually points to the larger image, so by retrieving the link's href, you're also getting the path to the larger file.
```js
 var imgPath = $(this).attr('href');
```

- **Get the current image:** We will need to fade out and remove the current image when the new one is fading in.
```js
var oldImage = $('#photo img');
```

- **Create a new image tag to insert into the page (newImage):** It will have the source of imgPath. This image is not displayed on the page yet, but the browser is ready to add it to the page.
```js
var newImage = $('<img src=' + imgPath +' alt = "" >');
```

- **The new image is placed in the (photo) `<div>`.** It will not be seen until the old image fades out:
```js
$('#photo').prepend(newImage);
```

- **Fade out the oldImage:** This is achieved by using the fadeOut() action. We will also remove the old image from the DOM.
```js
oldImage.fadeOut(4500,function(){
  $(this).remove();
});
```

- **Load the first image:** When the page is loaded we want the first image to be displayed, so we will force a click event on the first link in the gallery `<div>`.
```js
$('#gallery a:first').click();
```

The complete piece of code is as follows:

```js
$('#gallery a').click(function(evt) {
  	evt.preventDefault();
	var imgPath = $(this).attr('href');
	var oldImage = $('#photo img');
	var newImage = $('<img src="' + imgPath +'" alt = "" >');
	$('#photo').prepend(newImage);
	oldImage.fadeOut(4500,function(){
		$(this).remove();
	});
});
$('#gallery a:first').click();
```
