# What are Events?

Web browsers are programmed to recognise basic actions like the page loading, someone moving a mouse, typing a key, or resizing the browser window. 
Each of the things that happen to a web page is an event. To make your web page interactive, you write programs that respond to events. In this way, 
you can make a **<div** tag appear or disappear when a visitor clicks the mouse, a new image appear when she mouses over a link, or check the contents of a text field when she clicks a form's Submit button.

As you know, Event handlers are methods that are called when "something happens" in HTML. The term "triggered (or "fired") by an event" is often used.

Recall, preparing a web page to respond to an event is a three-stage process:

1. Select the element node(s) you want the script to respond to.
2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.
3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs.
