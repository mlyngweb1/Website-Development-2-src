# What are Events?

Web browsers are programmed to recognise basic actions like the page loading, someone moving a mouse, typing a key, or resizing the browser window. Each of the things that happen to a web page is an event. To make your web page interactive, you write programs that respond to events. In this way, you can make a `<div>` tag appear or disapper when a visitor clicks the mouse, a new image appear when she mouses over a link, or check the contents of a text field when she clicks a form's Submit button.

Event handlers are methods that are called when "something happens" in HTML. The term "triggered (or "fired") by an event" is often used.

Preparing a web page to respond to an event is a two-stage process:

1. Identify the page element that you wish to respond to an event.
2. Assign an event and define a function to run when the event occurs.
