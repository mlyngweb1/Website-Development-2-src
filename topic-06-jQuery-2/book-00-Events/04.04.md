# jQuery hover()

The mouseenter and mouseleave events are frequently used together. For example, when you mouse over a button, a menu might appear, move your mouse off the button, and the menu disappears. jQuery provides a shortcut of referring to both. The .hover() method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events. jQuery's .hover() method works like any other event, except it accepts two functions. The first function runs when the mouse travels over the element, and the second function runs when the mouse moves off the element. The basic structure looks like:

```js
$('#selector').hover(function1, function2);
```

In the following <a href="archives/examples/hoverlandscape.htm" target = "_ blank">example</a>, if we move the mouse over the image it changes; move the mouse away and the original image is restored.

```js
$('#myImage').hover(function(){
  $(this).attr('src', 'images/landscape.jpg');
   },
  function(){
  $(this).attr('src', 'images/landscape.gif');
});
```
