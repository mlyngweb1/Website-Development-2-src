# Exercise 1

- Create a folder called Week08.
- Download, extract and open the [Lab01](archives/lab01.zip) folder.

- In the js/exercise1.js file, add a jQuery script that does the following:
  - Hides and then displays the `<h2>` heading using the .slideDown() method. The .slideDown() method should use a parameter of 800 milliseconds.
  - Fades in each of the list items. There should be a delay of 800ms on each list item, and the fade in itself should also take 800ms.
  - When the user moves their mouse over a list item, use the animate method to increase the left padding by 10. The left padding should decrease by 10 when they move their mouse away from the list item.
  - When the user clicks on a list item, increase the left padding by 100 and the letter spacing by 10. The list item should also be removed from the list.
