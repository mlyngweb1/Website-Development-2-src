# Types of effects

When you start using jQuery, the effects methods can enhance your web page with transitions and movement. Here you can see some of the jQuery effects that show or hide elements and their content. You can animate them, fading in or out, or slide them up and down.

## Basic effects

- **.show()**: Displays selected elements
- **.hide()**: Hides selected elements
- **.toggle()**: Toggles between showing and hiding selected elements

## Fading effects

- **.fadeIn()**: Fades in selected elements making them opaque
- **.fadeOut()**: Fades out selected elements making them transparent
- **.fadeTo()**: Changes opacity of selected elements
- **.fadeToggle()**: Hides or shows selected elements by changing their opacity (the opposite of their current state)

## Sliding effects

- **.slideUp()**: Hides selected elements with a sliding motion
- **.slideDown()**: Shows selected elements with a sliding motion
- **.slideToggle()**: Hides or shows selected elements with a sliding motion (in the opposite direction to its current state)

## Custom effects

- **.delay()**: Delays execution of subsequent items in queue
- **.stop()**: Stops an animation if it is currently running
- **.animate()**: Creates custom animations (more on this later)

When an element that was previously hidden is shown, faded in, or slides into view, the other elements on the page may move to make space for it. When an element is hidden, has been faded out, or has slid out of view, the other elements on the page can move into the space these elements took up. Methods with *toggle* in their name will look at the current state of the element (whether it is visible or hidden) and will switch to the opposite state.
