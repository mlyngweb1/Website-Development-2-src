# Form methods & events

jQuery also provides methods that can be used with forms. For example, the .val() method gets the value from the first element in a selection; it can also be used to set the value for all matching elements.

## Form methods

- **.val()**: Primarily used with `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements. It can be used to get the value of the first element in a matched set, or update the value of all of them
- **.filter()**: Used to filter a jQuery selection using a second selector (especially form-specific filters)
- **.is()**: Often used with filters to check whether a form input is selected/checked
- **.isNumeric()**: Checks whether the value represents a numeric value and returns a Boolean.

## Events

The events shown here correspond to JavaScript events that you might use to trigger functions. They work with the .on() method; for example:

```js
$('#form').on('submit', function(){
  //code to be executed when submit button is clicked
});
```

- **blur**: When an element loses focus
- **change**: When the value of an input changes
- **focus**: When an element gains focus
- **select**: When the option for a `<select>` element is changed
- **submit**: When a form is submitted
