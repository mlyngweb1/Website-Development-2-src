# Prompt Box

The **prompt()** method produces a dialog box similar to the alert() method. However, instead of just displaying a message, 
the prompt() method can also retrieve an answer. You supply two strings to the prompt() method. 
The first string is the question or prompt you are giving the user. The second string is optional but it allows you to give a default value in the text field or leave it blank. If you supply no value the text field will include the text undefined (in some browsers).

The prompt box syntax is: **prompt("yourtext","defaultvalue");**

The user must click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering the text.

Typical use is when the user should input a value before entering the page.

Examples could be entering user's name to be stored in a cookie or entering a password or code of some kind.

- If the user clicks "OK" the prompt box returns the entry. 
- If the user clicks "Cancel" the prompt box returns null.

Since you usually want to use the input from the prompt box for some purpose it is normal to store the input in a variable, as shown in this example.

~~~
username=prompt("Please enter your name","");
