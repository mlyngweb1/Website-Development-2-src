# Alert Box

The **alert()** method pops up a dialog box displaying some information. This dialog box includes an **OK** button that needs 
to be clicked to close the dialog box.

The syntax for an alert box is: **alert("yourtext");**

The user will need to click "OK" to proceed. 

Typical use is when you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

Examples could be warnings of any kind. Typical examples include "Adult Content", or technical matters 
like "This site requires Shockwave Flash plug-in".
