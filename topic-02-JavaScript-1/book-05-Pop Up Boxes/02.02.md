# Confirm Box

The **confirm()** method pops up a dialog box displaying some information with an option for the user to accept the information 
(**OK**) or reject the information (**Cancel**).

The syntax for a confirm box is: **confirm("yourtext");**

The user needs to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

Typical use is when you want the user to verify or accept something.

Examples could be age verification like "Confirm that you are at least 57 years old" or technical matters like "Do you have a plug-in for Shockwave Flash?"

~~~
if (confirm("Do you agree")) {
  alert("You agree")}
else{alert ("You do not agree")}
~~~

If the user clicks "OK", the box returns the value true.
If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns the value false.
