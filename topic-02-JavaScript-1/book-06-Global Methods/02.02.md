# Examples

In the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example2.htm" target= "_blank">example</a>, we prompt the user for a number and then
test the value input. 

If the value entered includes a nonnumeric character then it is deemed to be invalid.

~~~
<script type="text/javascript">
 var mynum=prompt('Enter a Number between 1 and 10','');
 if (isNaN(mynum)) {
   document.write('You did not enter a Number');
 }
 else {
   document.write('The Number you entered was ' + mynum);
 }
</script>
~~~

Now, in the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example3.htm" target= "_blank">example</a>, we again prompt the user for a number and then
test the value input. 

If the value entered includes a nonnumeric character (after a numeric character/or numeric characters) then it is truncated.

~~~
<script type="text/javascript">
 var mynum=parseInt(prompt('Enter a Number between 1 and 10',''));
 if (isNaN(mynum)) {
   document.write('You did not enter a Number');
 }
 else {
   document.write('The Number you entered was ' + mynum);
 }
</script>
~~~

This example only returns that it is not a number if the first character is not numeric.
