# Where to Place it

Since JavaScript isn't HTML, you will need to let the browser know in advance when you enter JavaScript to an HTML page. 
This is done using the **&lt;script&gt;** tag. 
The browser will use the **&lt;script&gt;** and **&lt;/script&gt;** to tell where JavaScript starts and ends. 
In higher versions of HTML, such as HTML5 you can use **&lt;script&gt;** and **&lt;/script&gt;** instead. 


The word **alert** is a standard JavaScript command that will cause an alert box to pop up on the screen. The visitor will need to click the "OK" button in the alert box to proceed. 

By entering the **alert** command between the **&lt;script&gt;** and **&lt;/script&gt;** tags, the browser will recognize 
it as a JavaScript command. 
If we had not entered the **&lt;script&gt;** tags, the browser would simply recognize it as pure text, and just write it on the screen. 
You can enter JavaScript in both the **&lt;head&gt;** and **&lt;body&gt;** sections of the document.
