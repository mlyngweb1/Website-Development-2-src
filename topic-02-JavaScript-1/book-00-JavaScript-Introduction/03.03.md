# Document.Write

Consider this <a href="archives/Class Files/example2.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Using document.write()</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
  document.write("Welcome to my world!!!");
</script>
</body>
</html>
~~~

Instead of having JavaScript write something in a popup box we could have it written directly into the document. 

The **document.write** is a JavaScript command telling the browser that what follows within the parentheses is to be written 
into the document. 

**Note**: When entering text in JavaScript you need to include it in " ".

Now consider this <a href="archives/Class Files/example3.htm" target = "_blank">Example</a>, where we add text directly to the document 
after the existing HTML text.
