# Facts to Note

Knowing that JavaScript needs to be entered between **&lt;script&gt;** tags, is a start. But there are a few other things you need to know before writing your first JavaScript:

-JavaScript lines end with a semicolon. <br>
&nbsp;You may have noticed from the example on the previous page that JavaScript lines end with a semicolon. <br>
&nbsp;You can easily put all your JavaScript on a single line without destroying the performance of it.However, you would destroy the overview of your script so it is not advisable.


-Always put string text within quotes (single or double).<br>
&nbsp;When entering text to be handled by JavaScript, you should always put the text within quotes.<br>
&nbsp;If you forget to enclose your text in " ", JavaScript will interpret your text as being variables rather than text. 

-Capital letters are different from lowercase letters.<br>
 &nbsp;You should always remember that capital letters are different from lowercase letters. <br>
 &nbsp;This means that when you write commands in JavaScript, you need to type capital letters in the correct places, and nowhere else.
