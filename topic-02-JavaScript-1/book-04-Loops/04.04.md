# Do ... While Loops

If you want your loop to iterate at least once, use a **do ... while** loop so the condition is not tested until after 
all the statements are executed.

We will now look at an <a href="archives/Class Files/example3.htm" target = "_blank">example</a> that uses a **Do While** loop.

~~~
<script>
do
{
    ans=prompt("Enter a Positive Number, 0 to end","");
}while (ans>=0)
</script>
