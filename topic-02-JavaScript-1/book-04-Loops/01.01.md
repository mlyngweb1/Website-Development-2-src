Imagine that you wanted a script to perform the same routine over and over again 50 times in a row. 
An example could be if you wanted a script to produce a table comparing temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius. The script 
should produce 50 lines in a table showing different temperatures according to the two scales. 
Instead of adding 50 almost identical lines in your script you could use a loop to enable the script to perform a task like this.

There are two different kinds of loops: **for** and **while**. 

The **for** loop is used when you know in advance how many times the script should perform. For example if you wanted it to 
create exactly 50 lines. 

The **while** loop is used when you want the loop to continue until a certain condition becomes true. 
For example, if you wanted to make a table comparing Celsius and Fahrenheit, stepping 15 degrees for each row, 
and you wanted the table to contain values up to 1200 degrees of Celsius.
