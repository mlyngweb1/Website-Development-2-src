# Break and Continue

Two special commands can be used in loops: **break** and **continue**.

## Break

**Break** simply breaks the loop and continues with what might follow after the loop.

An example would be if you had a loop to calculate the squareroot of numbers decrementing from 50.

Since calculating the square root of a negative number is an illegal mathemathic operation you would like the loop to end when the square root of zero had been calculated. 

~~~
if (value==0) {break};
~~~

## Continue

**Continue** breaks the current loop and continues with the next value.

An example would be if you had a loop that divided a certain value with a factor of numbers ranging from -50 to +50.

Since division by zero is an illegal mathemathic procedure the loop should skip this iteration.

~~~
for (value=-50; value<=50; value=value+1)
{
  if (value==0) {continue};
  document.write((100/value)+"<br>");
~~~
