# Part Two

- Open the Week02 folder and create another folder called lab02.
- Open the lab02 folder.
- Create web pages that include JavaScript code for each of the following and store them in the lab02 folder:

  1	**mycalculator1.html**: Prompt the user for 2 numbers, add, subtract, multiply and divide them.
  Output the 4 results to the screen. 
  Remember to use **parseInt()** when you request the 2 numbers (e.g.  num1 = parseInt(prompt(...));)

  2	**selection1.html**: Prompt the user for a number (between 1 and 12). Using the switch statement, 
  output the corresponding month. E.g. 1 = January, 12 = December. Remember to include a default 
  option for values that are out of range.

  3	**variables.html**: Output (using a for loop) the even numbers from 2 to 20. Calculate the average of these numbers also.
  
  4    **selection2.html**:Prompt the user for a number (between 1 and 10). If it is equal to a value, 
  which you decide, display a message such as: You have guessed correctly. If not, display a message stating 
  whether it is too high or too low. Prompt the user until the user guesses the correct number and keep track 
  of the number of attempts.
