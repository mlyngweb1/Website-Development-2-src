# Part One

- Create a folder called Week02.
- Open the Week02 folder and create another folder called lab01.
- Open the lab01 folder.
- Create web pages that include JavaScript code for each of the following and store them in the lab01 folder:

  1	**words.html**: Create two variables; assign the value **Cookie** to one of the variables, 
and assign the value **Monster** to the other. Display the values of the two variables with a space added between the two 
values on the one line.

  2	**prompt.html**: Prompt the user for their email address, and then output a statement, such as 
**The email address entered was... **.

  3	**variables.html**: Declare a variable called **whatsit**. Assign a value to the variable and then output the 
variable value and its datatype. Then assign another value to the same variable and output the variable value and its datatype 
again. Repeat this a few times, each time assigning different values to the variable such as (21, Kilkenny, 56.99, true).
Your statements may include no words except **Value is... and the type is... **. 
Use simple HTML to output each statement on its own line.
