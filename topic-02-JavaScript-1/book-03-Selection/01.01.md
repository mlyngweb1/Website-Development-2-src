# If ... else

Sometimes JavaScript requires the ability to make distinctions between different options/choices.

For example, you might have a script that checks which browser the user arrives with. If it's MSIE, 
a page specifically designed for that browser should be loaded, if it's Chrome another page should be loaded.

The general syntax for **if** statements is:

~~~
if (condition) 
   {action1} 
else 
   {action2}
~~~

An example could be:

~~~
if (browser=="MSIE") 
   {alert("You are using MSIE")}
else 
   {alert("You are using Chrome")} 
~~~

**Notes**:

- Again it is important to note that if is written as "if". Using the capital "IF" would cause an error. 

- Also note that when comparing variables you will need to have two equals signs next to each other (==) (more on this later). If we wrote browser="MSIE" we would actually store "MSIE" in the variable called browser. When you write browser=="MSIE" JavaScript knows that you want it to compare rather than assign a value. 

- More complex if statements can be made by simply entering new if statements in the else part: 

~~~
if (condition) 
   {action1} 
else {if (condition) {action2}
else {action3}

An <a href="archives/Class Files/example1.htm" target = "_blank">example</a>:

~~~
if (browser=="Firefox" || browser=="firefox" || browser=="FIREFOX"){
    alert("You are using Mozilla Firefox")
}
else {if (browser=="Chrome" || browser=="chrome" ||browser=="CHROME") {
    alert("You are using Google Chrome")
     }
    else {
    alert("You are using an unknown browser")
    }
