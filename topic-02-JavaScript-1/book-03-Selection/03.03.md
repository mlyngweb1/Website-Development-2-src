# And, Or & Not

To further enhance your if statements you can use the so-called **logical** operators.

## And

**And** is written as **&&** and allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that *all of them have to 
individually evaluate to **true** for the whole expression to return true*.

Eg: If the basket contains egg and the basket contains bacon, we can have egg and bacon.

The syntax is: 

~~~
if (condition && condition) {
 action;
}
~~~

For example:
~~~
if (hour==12 && minute==0) {
  alert("it's noon");
}
~~~

## Or

**Or** is written as **||** and allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that *one or more of them have to individually 
evaluate to **true** for the whole expression to return true*. 

Eg: If the basket contains milk or the basket contains water, we can have something to drink.

The syntax is: 

~~~
if (condition || condition) {
  action;
}
~~~

For example:
~~~
if (hour==11 || hour==10) {
  alert("it's less than 2 hours till noon");
} 
~~~

## Not

**Not** is written as **!** and is used to invert the result.

Eg: If not the basket contains egg or not the basket contains bacon, we can't have egg and bacon.

The syntax is: 

~~~
if (!(condition)) {
  action;
}
~~~

For example:
~~~
if (!(hour==11)) {
 alert("it's more than 1 hour till noon");
} 
~~~
