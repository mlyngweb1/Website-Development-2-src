# Switch

The **switch** statement is another useful construct that works on a conditional basis. When you need to make a choice 
between more than two items you will find the switch statement much easier to write and maintain.


The general syntax for **switch** statements is:

~~~
switch (variable) {
  case 'value 1':
    perform some action when variable == 'value 1';
    break;
  case 'value 2':
    perform some action when variable == 'value 2';
    break;
  default:
    perform  action if none of the above is true;
}
~~~

The first line of a switch statement begins with the keyword **switch**, followed by a variable name inside brackets, 
followed by an opening brace symbol ({). 

Essentially the code says "Let's get the value of this variable and see if it matches one of several values". 

Each test is called a **case**, and a switch statement has one or more cases. 

The case keyword indicates the beginning of a case; it is followed by some value and then a colon. 

You must then indicate what is to be done next, such as display a message; or execute a function, etc... 

For each case entry, you add a **break**; statement. This step is important - the break; statement exits the switch statement.

You can also add a **default** keyword before the closing brace (}). This statement applies if none of the test cases is true.

The switch statement is illustrated in the following <a href="archives/Class Files/example2.htm" target = "_blank">example</a>:

~~~
ans=prompt("Which Fruit do you like","apple");
switch (ans)
{
case "apple":
  document.write("<h1>You like Apples</h1>");
  break;
case "orange":
  document.write("<h1>You like Oranges</h1>");
  break;
default:
   document.write("<h1>You like " + ans + "s</h1>");
}
